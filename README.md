Web development assessment

What I did to run this application:
1. Install XAMPP.
2. Place "/Sean_Asbee_Assessment/" into "/xampp/htdocs/" folder.
3. Go to URL: "localhost/phpmyadmin" and import the sql file located at "/Sean_Asbee_Assessment/Model/library.sql" as a new database.
4. Go to URL: "localhost/Sean_Asbee_Assessment/View/" to get started!
